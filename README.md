"L0SS" is an experimental photography project inspired by the interesting things that happen to JPEG files when they're repeatedly compressed or become corrupted. Each image in the series started with a digital photograph that I took, manipulated and iterated dozens of times to create the final product. My fascination with these glitches and other visual anomalies is what fueled this project.
